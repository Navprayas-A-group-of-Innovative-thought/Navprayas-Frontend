#### File Instructions

- Keep all components in component folder
- Create a Folder for component and add index.js as main file . So if we import that folder inside any other file . index file is by default imported.

  - You can check how i have added for header and footer
  - Now if this folder is require and small children component follow below naming convention
  - Naming conventions of children components : componentName.component.js

- Keep the custom styling in same folder Component in which it is applicable
  - Naming conventions : componentName.css
    > Note:- componentName is the component where style is applicable
- Page folder contains all the pages
- All Redux file will be inside Redux Folder
  - Naming conventions
    - Action Name: sample.action.js
    - Constant Name: sample.constant.js
    - Reducer Name: sample.reducer.js

Happy Coding !!!
